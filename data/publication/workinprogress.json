    "description": "<div> Robust isolation of a qubit from unwanted environmental noise is a critical factor in technologies such as quantum computers. Understanding the spectrum of noise acting on a qubit can yield valuable information about its environment and crucially underpins the optimization of dynamical decoupling protocols to mitigate such noise. To address this challenge we use deep-learning algorithms and demonstrate a neural-network-based methodology that extracts the noise spectrum associated with any qubit surrounded by an arbitrary bath. In practice, the experimental noise spectrum varies significantly between different qubits in ways that are non-trivial to either predict or, indeed, to extract from the most common measurements accurately. As a result, it is difficult to predict a priori which of the several possible dynamical decoupling protocols would provide optimal suppression of decoherence.</div>",
